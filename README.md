# ImagePackager
#### Image Packager : An Android application searching and compressing images  

### Motivation  
For storing all images I've taken, I used to compress them and stack onto an external storage like Cloud.
However, there was not the function on my gallery application.
That's why I should have moved the images to my computer, compressed them into ZIP, and then moved to the storage again.
I had to develop an image application with the function.  

### Description  
With this application on Android, you can search images 
  
### Notification
