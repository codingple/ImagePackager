# ImagePackager
#### Image Packager : An Android application searching and compressing images  

### Motivation  
For storing all images I've taken, I used to compress them and stack onto an external storage like Cloud.
However, there was not the function on my gallery application.
That's why I should have moved the images to my computer, compressed them into ZIP, and then moved to the storage again.
I had to develop an image application with the compressing function for shorter progress.  

### Description  
With this application on Android, you can search images on your device with the file name or the date.
You can see the output images, and compress either all or a part of them into a ZIP file.  

### Usage  
* **Install**  
install the APK and execute the application
